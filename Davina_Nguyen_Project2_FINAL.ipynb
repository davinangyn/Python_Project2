    "## Scientific Question: CPT-CEF treatment is a drug treatment that effectively decreases the viability of cancer cells. Following the CPT-CEF treatment of HT29 colon cancer cells, which pathways are seen upregulated/downregulated leading to the epigenetic modification of HT29 colon cancer cells?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Epigenetic changes to DNA structure regulate gene expression by turning them on or off. An example would be an epigenetic change that downregulates genes involved in DNA repair, leading to an increase levels mutations in DNA, which drives cancer risk. Mutations in genes involved in repair allow damaged and abnormal DNA to replicate and divide,thus allowing cells to bypass cell arrest and apoptosis. These epigenetic modifications increase the likelihood of developing cancer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CPT-CEF (Camptothecin-cyclodextrin-EDTA-FE3O4) is an anticancer drug encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle to increase its solubility and efficiency in delivering the treatment to cancer tissue (Krishnan, Poorani, et al., 2017). CPT-CEF specifically inhibits topoisomerase 1 that induces apoptotic signaling pathway by cleaving DNA, thereby significantly reducing viability of HT29 colon cells with treatment (Farhana et al., 2021). \n",

    "## Scientific Hypothesis: If the genes involved in DNA repair ( HMGB1, APEX1, and POLE3) are downregulated in HT29 colon cancer cells, then overexpression of these genes should have low p-values and upregulated expression levels in CPT-CEF treated HT29 cells compared, impacting the downstream signalling of apoptosis and significantly inhibiting cancer progression.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying cause for normal cells becoming cancerous is due to DNA damage and that is left unrepaired. Damage to DNA repair genes that produce the necessary protein tools to repair DNA, which results in the accumulation of mutations in other genes. DNA repair damage has been found in colon cancer, involving these three genes: xHMGB1, APEX1, and POLE3 (Farhana et al., 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "The overexpression of genes involved in DNA repair are responsible for upregulating the apoptotic signaling pathway. The secretion of DNA repair proteins triggers inflammatory reactions that regulates downstream signaling of apoptotic factors to induce apoptosis (Farhana et al., 2021). \n",

    "The raw sequences of the control sample (untreated colon cancer cells) and sample treated with CPT-CEF were obtained from NBCI SRA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP304038&o=acc_s%3Aa). According to the website, this database contains: \"Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data, available through multiple cloud providers and NCBI servers, is the largest publicly available repository of high throughput sequencing data. The archive accepts data from all branches of life as well as metagenomic and environmental surveys. SRA stores raw sequencing data and alignment information to enhance reproducibility and facilitate new discoveries through data analysis.\" To identify conserved gene regions and DNA regions that are damaged vs altered by CPT-CEF, a multiple sequence alignment can be performed since there are two control samples (untreated) and two treatment samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "BLAST, or Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, is a program that locates similar regions between various sequences. It compares the nucleotides or protein sequences to existing databases and calculates the statistical significance of potential matches. Searches can be done to predict functional differences between sequences or to identify members of gene families.\n",
    "The nucleotide sequence of HMGB1 gene was downloaded from the NCBI nucleotide (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CR456863.1). A pairwise sequence alignment between HMGB1 and BLAST_Hit is performed. Looking at the BLAST search, HMGB1 is a highly conserved protein and present in the nucleus, which makes it a target for cancer. HMGB1 protein regulates transcription by interacting with histones of the chromatin, which ultimately alters its structure. \n",

The significant genes found to be upregulated are seen in green. The log fold change threshold was set to 0.05. The statistical signifcance was set to p<0.01. The significant data points (low p-value) are toward the top of the plot while the less significant data points (high p-values) are toward the bottom.

    "The figure above is a heatmap illustrating the upregulation and downregulation of the 12,000+ genes found in HT29 colon cells. RPM (reads per million mapped reads) is the counts per gene multiplied by 1,000,000 then divided by the total number of counts in the sample. The 'RPM_controls' is the normalized counts of the control (untreated) samples. The 'RPM_cpt-cef' is the normalized counts of the treated samples. The heatmap poorly demonstrates the differential gene expressions between the two conditions. I exprected to see 95 upregulated and 146 downregulated gene (Farhana et al., 2021). "
