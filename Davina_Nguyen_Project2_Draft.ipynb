    "Epigenetic changes to DNA structure regulates gene expression by turning them on or off. Epigenetic changes include DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA. An example would be an epigenetic change that downregulates genes involved in DNA repair mechanism, leading to an increase in DNA damage, which in turn, increases cancer risk. Mutations in genes involved in repair allow damaged and abnormal DNA to replicate and divide, bypassing cell arrest. CPT-CEF (Camptothecin-cyclodextrin-EDTA-FE3O4) is an anticancer drug encapsulated in a nanoparticle to increase its solubility and efficiency in battling cancer. CPT is a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor \n",
