You will need a two files in order to adequately run the code:

  1. The jupyter notebook
  2. The TXT file that was used (uploaded here)


Information about where the gene count matrix file was found: The genes expressed in HT29 colon cancer cells when untreated and treated with CPT-CEF could be obtained from the NCBI GEO DB (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE165875). I imported the data file named "GSE165875_Processed_gene_abundance_matrix.txt" in which a different expression analysis was performed. The output of this code is a csv file containing a p-values of gene count dataframe from lowest to highest p-values.
